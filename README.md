# Visual-Data-Pipeline-Designer-with-DAG-Validation
- A web-based application for building and validating node-based pipelines. 
- Users can visually create workflows, define dynamic text-based variables, and validate pipeline structure through backend graph analysis.

#  Key Features

Reusable node abstraction for scalable node creation

Dynamic text nodes with variable parsing and auto-generated input handles

Interactive pipeline editor with nodes and edges

Backend validation for node count, edge count, and DAG detection

Clear feedback on pipeline correctness
